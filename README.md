<h1>JavaScript Code Quiz</h1>

<h2> User Story:</h2>
<p> As a coding student I wanted to make a quiz application on JavaScript fundamentals which was timed and also keeps track of high scores. For every question you answer incorrectly, you will receive a 10 second time penalty. The more time you have left equals your score. You will have 90 seconds total to answer 6 JavaScript questions.</p>
